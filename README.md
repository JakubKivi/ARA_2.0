Second version of chesslike game

ARA is a C++ and SFML game, made by a group of friends during winter holiday in 2019 as a challange to make a game in only two weeks. It's a turn-based game simmilar to chess seemingly, but has huge twists, like different figures' moves, removal of the map or two moves each turn. The rules might be strange and tricky, at first, but after a few games they start to make sense, and you have a lot of fun playing the game. After winter holiday my friends practiclally abandoned the game projects.

This repo is made to make second, better version and finally end this. I am adding new graphics made by, of course, our graphic designer, and still, when I have some free time I am making some improvements. Hope that game will be fully playable and downloadable at the end of 2020.
